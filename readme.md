# Programming Dojo Website

This is the source code for [programming.dojo.net.nz](https://programming.dojo.net.nz).

[![Development Status](https://github.com/ioquatix/programming.dojo.net.nz/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ioquatix/programming.dojo.net.nz/actions?workflow=Development)

## Motivation

This website was designed as part of my university study with Dr. Tim Bell in the course "COSC433 Computer Science Education" in 2010. There is [a report](pages/resources/Programming%20Dojo%20Report.pdf) which covers the initial development of this site.

At the time I was concerned about the isolated approach to teaching programming languages in education. In particular, because teachers often lack the formal education, students often receive a biased impression about language strengths and weaknesses.

This website and the resources it makes available, are designed to encourage an open mind when it comes to programming languages, both for students and teachers. Even though teachers may only be comfortable with one language, students should understand this does not make it intrinsically better than any other language.

## Installation

Ensure you have a working Ruby interpreter.

Install all dependencies:

```
$ bundle install

```
$ rake
```

The site can be accessed locally using the default endpoint: [https://localhost:9292](https://localhost:9292).
