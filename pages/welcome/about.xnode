		<p>This site was designed by <a href="https://twitter.com/ioquatix" rel="me">Samuel Williams</a> as part of Computer Science Education course run by Tim Bell and Lynn Lambert. It has been designed to improve the awareness of different programming languages.</p>
	
		<p>For more details regarding the research that lead to the development of this site, please see the <a href="Programming Dojo Report.pdf">report</a>.</p>
	
		<h2>Title</h2>
	
		<p>The title ‘Programming Dojo’ was chosen due to the nature of our goal: Programming is a pathway to a greater understanding of the universe (in a metaphysical sense). The word ‘Dojo’ is actually pronounced ‘Dou-Jyou’, and written in Japanese Kanji ‘道場’; a crude translation: ‘Dou’ means pathway, and ‘Jyou’ means place. ‘Programming Dojo’ simply means the place where one can start on the pathway of programming.</p>
