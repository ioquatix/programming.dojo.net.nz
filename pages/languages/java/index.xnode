		<p>Java is a <content:tt>statically typed</content:tt> <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> programming language. It was designed as a language for <content:tt>cross platform</content:tt> application development.</p>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p>Java is generally <content:tt>compiled</content:tt> to <content:tt>bytecode</content:tt> that is then <content:tt>interpreted</content:tt> by the Java Virtual Machine. This allows the same <content:tt>bytecode</content:tt> to run on multiple platforms. The HotSpot JVM may also compile bytecode to native machine code for additional performance.</p>

		<p>Other languages such as <content:tt>JRuby</content:tt> and <content:tt>Clojure</content:tt> can also run on top of the JVM, which makes it an interesting platform for programming language development.</p>

		<h2>Why would I learn this language?</h2>

		<p>Java is a great language because it aims to provides a "write once, run anywhere" environment. While in practice, there are always additional complexities, Java code is generally cross platform.</p>

		<p>Java provides a highly structured environment which tends to promote good practices when it comes to software development, especially when more than one person is working on the source code.</p>

		<p>Java is not a purely <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> language, because it has primitive types (which are not objects). This creates imperfections in both syntactic and semantic constructs within the language.</p>

		<p>Due to the nature of all Java, code must always be defined within the scope of a class. This can requires a large amount of boiler plate code in certain scenarios.</p>
