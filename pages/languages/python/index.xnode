  <p>Python (currently version 3) is a <content:tt>dynamically typed</content:tt> programming language with both <content:tt>imperative</content:tt> and <content:tt>functional</content:tt> features. Python source code is executed by the Python <content:tt to="interpreted">interpreter</content:tt> which internally <content:tt>compiles</content:tt> the code to bytecode for better performance.</p>

  <h2>Why would I learn this language?</h2>

  <p>Python has a very clean syntax and a well thought out design.</p>

  <p>It is used in many different areas of software engineering such as web programming, scientific and numerical computing, and comes with a large standard library. There are many third party libraries available too.</p>

  <p>Python is used by many large organizations in many <a href="http://www.python.org/about/success/">successful projects</a>.</p>
