	<p>Perl is an <content:tt>dynamically typed</content:tt> programming language. It was initially designed as a language for system administration, but has since grown to provide a wide range of functionality in many different areas of software development and computer science.</p>
	
	<p>Perl has <content:tt>imperative</content:tt>, <content:tt>functional</content:tt> and <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> features, including both <content:tt>lexical scoping</content:tt> and <content:tt>dynamic scoping</content:tt> (although the latter isn't used much). Perl source code is executed by the Perl <content:tt to="interpreted">interpreter</content:tt> which internally <content:tt>compiles</content:tt> the code to bytecode for better performance.</p>
	
	<h3>Example Code</h3>
	
	<p>Here is an example of the <content:tt>100 doors</content:tt> problem:</p>
	
	<content:listing src="example.txt" brush="perl5" />
	
	<h3>Why would I learn this language?</h3>

	<p>Perl is a flexible dynamic programming language with many features. It is a great tool for system administration, web development and software testing.</p>
	
	<p>Perl code is very succinct and can be written very quickly, while still having good performance.</p>
