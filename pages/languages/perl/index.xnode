    <p>Perl is an <content:tt>dynamically typed</content:tt> programming language. It was initially designed as a language for system administration, but has since grown to provide a wide range of functionality in many different areas of software development and computer science.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Perl has <content:tt>imperative</content:tt>, <content:tt>functional</content:tt> and <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> features, including both <content:tt>lexical scoping</content:tt> and <content:tt>dynamic scoping</content:tt> (although the latter isn't used much). Perl source code is executed by the Perl <content:tt to="interpreted">interpreter</content:tt> which internally <content:tt>compiles</content:tt> the code to bytecode for better performance.</p>
