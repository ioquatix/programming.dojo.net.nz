		<p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a simple <content:tt>dynamic</content:tt> <content:tt>imperative</content:tt> programming language developed in the 1960s.</p>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p>BASIC was developed by Microsoft into several platforms, including <content:tt>QBasic</content:tt> and <content:tt>Visual Basic</content:tt>. Visual Basic has <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> features and includes a drag and drop user interface toolset. These tools are proprietary and generally only work on Microsoft Windows. Other dialects of BASIC exist for various platforms, such as <content:tt>REALbasic</content:tt>.</p>

		<h2>Example Code</h2>

		<p>Here is an example of the <content:tt>100 doors</content:tt> problem:</p>

		<content:listing src="example.txt" brush="basic" />

		<h2>Why would I learn this language?</h2>

		<p>BASIC is a simple language which is easy to learn. It provides a simple set of semantic constructs and data types. There are many <content:tt>free software</content:tt> implementations, but unfortunately the most typically used implementation is proprietary (Microsoft Visual Basic).</p>
