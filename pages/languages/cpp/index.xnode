		<p>C++ was initially designed as an extension of C and adds <content:tt>object oriented</content:tt> and <content:tt>meta programming</content:tt> features. Like C it is a <content:tt>statically typed</content:tt> <content:tt>imperative</content:tt> language, but in addition it provides many high level features such as <content:tt>exceptions</content:tt> and libraries.</p>

		<p>C++ is generally <content:tt>compiled</content:tt> and compilers exist for many platforms, however due to the complexity of the C++ standard, compilers don't always behave the same way.</p>

		<h2>Why would I learn this language?</h2>

		<p>C++ is in some ways a super-set of <a href="../c">C</a>. It was originally called "C with Objects". It adds many advanced language features such as classes, namespaces, exceptions and meta-programming.</p>

		<p>C++ has many of the same issues as C, but it also adds many new issues (complex syntax and semantic behavior). On the whole, however, it is a useful language which is used in many different industries.</p>

		<p>C++ provides a useful level of abstraction and performance, and is used in both application development. The majority of computer games are written using C++.</p>
