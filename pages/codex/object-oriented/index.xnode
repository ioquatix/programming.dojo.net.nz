	<p>Object oriented programming is a form of programming initially described by <tt>Alan Kay</tt> and used in his programming language <tt>Smalltalk</tt>. It describes programming language semantics where objects and messages between objects are the basis for computation.</p>
	
	<p>From this basis, other important concepts emerge including <tt>encapsulation</tt>, <tt>inheritance</tt> and <tt>polymorphism</tt>.</p>
