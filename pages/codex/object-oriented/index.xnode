	<p>Object oriented programming is a form of programming initially described by <content:tt>Alan Kay</content:tt> and used in his programming language <content:tt>Smalltalk</content:tt>. It describes programming language semantics where objects and messages between objects are the basis for computation.</p>
	
	<p>From this basis, other important concepts emerge including <content:tt>encapsulation</content:tt>, <content:tt>inheritance</content:tt> and <content:tt>polymorphism</content:tt>.</p>
