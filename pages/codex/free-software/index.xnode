	<p><em>Open Source</em> is different from <em>Free Software</em>. Free Software is software that respects your freedom. Open Source is software where you can see the source code.</p>
	
	<p>Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it means that the program's users have the four essential freedoms:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
		<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.  Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
		<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
		<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
	</ol>
