	<p>Exceptions are used to report exceptional conditions, such as invalid input to a function or a missing resource. Best practices vary widely between languages, but generally exceptions are used to indicate problems that don't fit into the standard flow of a program.</p>
	
	<p>Because of this, exceptions generally traverse up the <content:tt>stack</content:tt> of a program to a point where an error handler is defined for that particular exception. This is important because it allows error handling to be separate from main functionality. It also allows a program to define error handling code at a place where there is enough information to deal with the error correctly.</p>

	<p>Many languages such as <content:tt>Ruby</content:tt>, <content:tt>Java</content:tt> and <content:tt>Python</content:tt> support some kind of exception handling. Some languages provide more general language facilities such as <content:tt>coroutines</content:tt> which can be used to implement exceptions.</p>
